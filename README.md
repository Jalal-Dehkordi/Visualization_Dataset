Training to visualize the data of a fake Dataset
# Data Visualization and Analysis with Python and Pandas

This repository contains a Python code for generating random dataset and performing analysis using the pandas library, as well as visualizing the data. This resource is created to teach fundamental concepts of data analysis and visualization to individuals interested in learning these topics.


The generated dataset is created using numpy with synthetic/fake data, and the primary focus is on visualizing and illustrating various aspects of the dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Numpy library
-Matplotlib library
-Seaborn library


## Steps:
1. Define a dictionary to create synthetic data using numpy.
2. Convert the data into a DataFrame.
3. Obtain general information about the Data Frame.
4. Display graphical visualizations of the data based on its features.
